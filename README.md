# Goodbook Recommendation System
With the increase in the number of books and ways to read books, it has become difficult for readers to choose a book to read. In this digital era, we can recommend a book to the reader based on various factors such as his interests, reading habits, and reactions to other books. There are a few recommendation systems available that will use either the characteristics of books or users.

## Dataset
The dataset contains six million ratings given by 53.4k users for 10,000 books and it is taken from [here](http://fastml.com/goodbooks-10k-a-new-dataset-for-book-recommendations/). It contains several CSV files. The description for each CSV file is shown below:
- ```books.csv```: Contains 23 features about all the 10k books
- ```ratings.csv```: Comprises of more than around 6 million records of ratings given by the users to the books 
- ```books_tags.csv```: Contains 33 million records of tags assigned to the books
- ```tags.csv```: Consists of tag details assigned to books by the users

You can download the dataset from this [link](https://psu.box.com/s/xmwzl2bjj3nzpg140gp8stfcpi0xcn92) and replace the location in the above notebooks.

Three main recommendation methods used are ```Collaborative```, ```Content-based``` and ```Matrix-Factorization```. The conceptualization is based on the Chapter 9 of the book [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html). <br>
